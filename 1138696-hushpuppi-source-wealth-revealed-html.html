After his sudden rise to riches, people began questioning the source of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hushpuppi's wealth</a>. Some said he was a gambler, while others insisted that he was a fraudster of some sort.

He was then extradited to the United States of America, where he would later face charges for conspiracy to launder money.</p><p class=align-left>Part of the charges included the use of business email compromise to defraud individuals and organizations and other scams and schemes. For example, it is said that<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Hushpuppi defrauded</a> an American law firm of $40 million, targeted to steal $124 million from an English football club, and illegally transferred $14.7 million from a foreign financial institution.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/975243649df05e6e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nigerian billionaire Arthur Eze buys private jet reportedly worth 63 billion naira, video stirs reactions</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Additionally, the FBI stated that the Nigerian, along with his counterparts, had defrauded a New York law firm out of $922,857 back in 2019.
