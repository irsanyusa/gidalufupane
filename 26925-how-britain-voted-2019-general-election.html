election</h1><div id=sub-header>July 2024 · 5 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><h3>YouGov conducts one of Britain's biggest ever post-election surveys to chart how the nation's political character is shifting</h3><p>YouGov has conducted the largest survey yet on last week’s general election, interviewing over 40,000 British adults to discover patterns across demographics: age, gender, class, education and previous votes.</p><h4><strong>Age is still the biggest dividing line in British politics</strong></h4><p>In the EU referendum and again in 2017 <a href=#>age was a new dividing line in British politics</a>. The data indicates that little has changed on this front over the past two years, with Labour still winning a majority of younger voters and the Conservatives miles ahead among older Britons.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/How20Britain20voted20201920age-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>In fact, for every 10 years older a voter is, their chance of voting Tory increases by around nine points, and the chance of them voting Labour decreases by eight points.</p><p>The tipping point - the age at which a voter is more likely to have voted Conservative than Labour - is now 39, down from 47 at the last election.</p><a _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 class="link ng-star-inserted" href=#><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/How20Britain20voted20201920age20crossover20.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><a href=#>Click to enlarge</a></p><p>Labour is down among all age groups, although slightly less so among those nearing or in retirement, losing just 5% of their vote share among the over 60s, compared to around 9% among the under 60s. However, given how badly they did among the over 60s in the last election, they didn’t have much more to lose.</p><h4><strong>There is a gender gap, but only among the young</strong></h4><p>The data points towards a very small gender gap, with the Conservatives on 46% among men and 44% among women, and Labour on 31% among men and 35% among women.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/How20Britain20voted20201920age20and20gender.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>But when you break this down it is most evident among the very youngest. If we just look at those aged from 18 to 24 the Conservatives are on 28% among men and just 15% among women.</p><p>On the Labour side, the party are on 46% among young men and 65% among young women, a gap of 19%.</p><h4><strong>Conservatives perform best across all social grades</strong></h4><p>The Conservatives comfortably outperformed Labour across all social grades, further evidence that class is no longer a key indicator of how people vote. In fact, the Conservatives actually did better amongst C2DE voters (48%) than they did amongst ABC1 voters (43%). Labour performed the same amongst both social grade groups (33%).</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/How20Britain20voted20201920social20grade-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>This is a further realignment of voters by class that we first saw in 2017. The Conservatives performed equally well amongst ABC1 voters and C2DE voters (44%) two years ago, marginally better than Labour in both cases. Now they have improved their showing amongst C2DEs while achieving the same as 2017 amongst ABC1s.</p><h4><strong>Education is still a key dividing line</strong></h4><p>The highest level of education someone has achieved remains an important dividing line in how people vote. Labour did much better than the Conservatives amongst those who have a degree or higher, by 43% to 29%.</p><p>The Liberal Democrats also performed very well amongst this group with 17% of the vote share. We saw in 2016 that those with a higher education level were overwhelmingly more likely to back remaining in the EU, and this has seemingly transferred into party voting.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/How20Britain20voted20201920education20level.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>The Conservatives won amongst the much larger group of voters who do not hold a degree, however. They outperformed Labour by more than two to one (58% to 25%) amongst those whose highest level of education is GCSE or lower.</p><p>Compared to 2017, the Conservatives have improved amongst those without a degree, but performed worse amongst those with a degree or higher. Labour lost voters amongst all three education level groups.</p><h4><strong>Retention of 2017 voters was crucial to Conservative success</strong></h4><p>The Conservatives did a much better job than Labour of retaining their 2017 voters. Some 85% of those who voted Conservative in 2017 stuck with them in 2019, compared to 72% of Labour voters.</p><p>The only party with a better retention of 2017 voters was the SNP, who kept hold of 87% of their past voters.</p><a _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 class="link ng-star-inserted" href=#><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/How20Britain20voted20201920201720vote20sank.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><a href=#>Click to enlarge</a></p><p>Labour lost similar numbers of voters to the Conservatives (11%) as they did to the Liberal Democrats (9%). The potential threat of the Brexit Party at the start of the campaign proved to do little damage to the Tories, attracting just 2% of 2017 Conservatives. One in five (19%) 2017 UKIP voters backed the Brexit Party, while two thirds (67%) moving to the Tories.</p><p>Despite improving their overall vote share from 8% to 12% this election, the Liberal Democrats only retained 59% of their 2017 voters. One in five of this group moved to Labour and 14% voted Conservative.</p><p>This loss of voters was balanced by winning over new voters from across all other parties. The Greens also struggled with retaining their 2017 voters (keeping just 30%) with a third (34%) moving to Labour.</p><h4><strong>Brexit realignment continues</strong></h4><p>Brexit realignment was already a huge factor in the last general election, with 55% of Remainers voting Labour and 65% of Leavers voting Conservative.</p><p>This time around the Conservatives managed to boost their vote share amongst Leave voters to three quarters (74%) while the Labour Party actually reduced their share of Remain voters to just under half (49%). This fall came mainly at the hands of the Liberal Democrats, who increased their vote share amongst Remain voters to 21%, compared to 12% in 2017.</p><a _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 class="link ng-star-inserted" href=#><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/How20Britain20voted20201920EUref20sankey-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><a href=#>Click to enlarge</a></p><p>Both the Conservatives and Labour lost voters on the other side of the Brexit debate. The Conservatives held on to 19% of Remainers (down from 25% in 2017) while Labour’s vote share amongst Leavers was 14% (down from 24% in 2017).</p><h4><strong>EU referendum and 2017 voters</strong></h4><p>The Conservatives managed to keep hold of almost all (92%) of their 2017 voters who were on the Leave side in 2016. Labour were able to hold onto 8 in 10 (79%) of their 2016 Remain voters, although 12% deserted the party in favour of the Liberal Democrats.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/How20Britain20voted20201920EUref20and202017.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Despite their strong stance on leaving the EU, the Conservatives managed to convince two thirds (65%) of their voters who backed remain in 2016 to stick with them this time round. 22% voted Lib Dem, while 8% moved to the Labour party.</p><p>Only half (52%) of those who voted leave in 2016 and Labour in 2017, stuck with the Labour party in 2019. A third (33%) moved directly to the Conservatives, while 6% voted for the Brexit party.</p><p>Photo: Getty</p><p><a href=#><strong>See the full results here</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYmuGc4GMoaawZZKntrWtyKdkr6ekmrFufo9qcGaflaOys63LZpylnZOptrC6</p></div><div id=links><a href=./le-ppp-pour-les-ecoles-marseillaises-menace-dannulation.html>&#171;&nbsp;Le PPP pour les coles marseillaises menac d'annulation</a>
