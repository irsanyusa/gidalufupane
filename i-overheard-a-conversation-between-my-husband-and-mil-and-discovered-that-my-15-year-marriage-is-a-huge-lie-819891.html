The woman wanted to&nbsp;pour her heart out and to&nbsp;find out people’s opinions about her family situation that turned her life into a&nbsp;total mess.</p><p>Rosa opened her letter, saying, “Hi&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>! I’m totally desperate about my&nbsp;family life at&nbsp;the moment, and&nbsp;I couldn’t have imagined that such an&nbsp;outrageous thing would ever happen to&nbsp;me.</p><p>My&nbsp;husband Mark and&nbsp;I have known each other for 15&nbsp;years, and we’ve been married for 14&nbsp;years. I’ve always believed that our <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> initiated from a&nbsp;very big, sincere and mutual feeling. I’ve always taken pride in&nbsp;my&nbsp;special relationship with my&nbsp;husband and&nbsp;I sincerely believed that we&nbsp;did have that strong bond, mutual trust and lots of&nbsp;respect towards each other.</p><p>Our <a href=# title="love story" data-link=tag>love story</a> was so&nbsp;special and this gave me&nbsp;the reason to&nbsp;think that our happy union would last forever, but&nbsp;I was so&nbsp;wrong and so&nbsp;blind.”</p><p><h2>Mark and Rosa fell in&nbsp;love under very special circumstances.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/46e/d92/232d795a1a8b5ed46686d580b6.jpg><p>Rosa goes on&nbsp;with her story, saying, “Mark and&nbsp;I first met each other at&nbsp;my&nbsp;dad’s funeral. I&nbsp;was grieving the loss of&nbsp;my&nbsp;only parent (my&nbsp;dad raised me&nbsp;alone after my&nbsp;mom passed away when&nbsp;I was a&nbsp;toddler).<br>My&nbsp;dad and&nbsp;I had always been very close, and he&nbsp;did everything and anything for making my&nbsp;life a&nbsp;fairy tale. Dad was a&nbsp;very famous artist, whose works were admired by&nbsp;many people, and he&nbsp;made a&nbsp;very good income from his paintings. He&nbsp;owned several art galleries and his name was recognized and honored in&nbsp;wide circles.</p><p>Dad had a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;very devoted friends, who all came to&nbsp;his funeral to&nbsp;honor his memory. One of&nbsp;these friends brought his son along to&nbsp;the dad’s funeral, and this was Mark, my&nbsp;then future husband.</p><p>After my&nbsp;dad’s funeral, Mark was all attention. He&nbsp;immediately started offering me&nbsp;help and support in&nbsp;everything&nbsp;I might need during that darkest time. I&nbsp;happily accepted his help and this was the time when we&nbsp;became friends, and&nbsp;I fell in&nbsp;love with this man.</p><p>Mark and&nbsp;I started dating soon after&nbsp;I healed from my&nbsp;immense loss. And 2&nbsp;years after my&nbsp;dad’s funeral and our first encounter with Mark, we&nbsp;tied the knot.”</p><p><h2>Rosa’s husband has always been a&nbsp;very good partner, but she did notice some red flags.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/46e/3b1/86844e5164b5c0b3ee4a24d72e.jpg><p>Rosa wrote, “Our marriage was a&nbsp;very blessed and happy union from the very beginning. Mark was a&nbsp;good and caring husband and a&nbsp;doting dad. He&nbsp;always insisted that we&nbsp;must have as&nbsp;many kids as&nbsp;possible, and he&nbsp;said that he&nbsp;couldn’t imagine family life without children.</p><p>I&nbsp;did want to&nbsp;have kids, too. But my&nbsp;plan was to&nbsp;have one child and give all my&nbsp;love and attention to&nbsp;them. Mark insisted that we&nbsp;have 3&nbsp;kids, and&nbsp;I didn’t object. To&nbsp;my&nbsp;shock, he&nbsp;lost<strong> </strong>any interest in&nbsp;our children soon after their birth.</p><p>When I&nbsp;gave birth to&nbsp;our first baby son, Mark was on&nbsp;cloud nine. Then, 2&nbsp;years after, we&nbsp;welcomed baby twins into our family.<br>As&nbsp;the kids were growing&nbsp;up, Mark was becoming more and more distant from them, which became a&nbsp;real problem in&nbsp;the family, and&nbsp;I was never able to&nbsp;understand why Mark was behaving like this with the kids, and he&nbsp;would never give me&nbsp;any reasonable explanation about his behavior. He&nbsp;only kept saying that&nbsp;I was overthinking, and he&nbsp;even advised me&nbsp;to&nbsp;visit a&nbsp;doctor because of&nbsp;my&nbsp;anxiety about his parenting style.”</p><p><h2>Rosa’s in-laws had also behaved in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very strange way.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b5b/70f/0d65ba575a8c9d7e7d87f8666e.jpg><p>Rosa wrote, “I&nbsp;must mention here that my&nbsp;MIL, Ashley, and my&nbsp;FIL, Jonathan, used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;very close with my&nbsp;deceased father. When Mark and&nbsp;I got married, my&nbsp;in-laws were very good to&nbsp;me, and they also insisted that Mark and&nbsp;I must have at&nbsp;least 3&nbsp;kids together.</p><p>When our kids were born, neither of&nbsp;them showed any signs of&nbsp;love and interest in&nbsp;their grandchildren. Both in-laws were absolutely indifferent about their grandchildren, and sometimes they even forgot about their birthdays, which&nbsp;I found appalling, especially after they initially wanted so&nbsp;many grandchildren. Their behavior was very strange, but they were still very good to&nbsp;me, and they often took my&nbsp;side when Mark and&nbsp;I had conflicts or&nbsp;arguments about anything.</p><p>I’ve always thought their behavior towards our children was a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;some family trauma or&nbsp;something. I&nbsp;didn’t even try to&nbsp;find an&nbsp;explanation for their attitude, and&nbsp;I calmed myself by&nbsp;the thought that I’m my&nbsp;children’s mom and&nbsp;I love them all more than anything, and this was the only thing that was very important for the kids.”</p><p>Rosa added, “Recently, I&nbsp;found out why Mark and his parents were behaving in&nbsp;such a&nbsp;weird manner all these years, and&nbsp;I can say that the truth hit me&nbsp;really hard.”</p><p><h2>Rosa overheard a&nbsp;talk between Mark and his mother and made a&nbsp;shocking discovery.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6a0/379/8bdc6e52e6897bdfa827622403.jpg><p>Rosa wrote, “Mark and&nbsp;I were approaching our 15th wedding anniversary, and&nbsp;I was very busy preparing for a&nbsp;very nice celebration. Recently, I&nbsp;came home from work and was going to&nbsp;call Mark and ask him if&nbsp;he&nbsp;made some arrangements about our celebration that were his responsibility. I&nbsp;thought he&nbsp;wasn’t home, but then&nbsp;I heard his voice, he&nbsp;was not alone, I&nbsp;heard Ashley speaking in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very emotional tone.<br>She was saying, ’You did&nbsp;it, my&nbsp;boy! One more year and you’ll be&nbsp;a&nbsp;free and rich man, you won’t need to&nbsp;pretend anymore and you’ll be&nbsp;finally happy! And you won’t have to&nbsp;work any single day anymore, no&nbsp;more burdens and no&nbsp;more misery for you, my&nbsp;son! I’m so&nbsp;happy for you!’”</p><p>Rosa wrote, “I&nbsp;heard them talking about my&nbsp;dad’s will and some woman named Ann, whom Mark loved and with whom he&nbsp;would be&nbsp;finally happy together without any need to&nbsp;hide. This all was strange, and&nbsp;I could feel that something bad was happening, bad for me&nbsp;and my&nbsp;kids.”</p><p>Rosa said, “I&nbsp;immediately thought about my&nbsp;dad’s will. The peculiarity about it&nbsp;was that it&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;announced right during our 15th wedding anniversary. And my&nbsp;father-in-law was the person who was going to&nbsp;do&nbsp;so, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;was my&nbsp;dad’s close friend. I&nbsp;rushed to&nbsp;my&nbsp;FIL and told him that&nbsp;I knew there was something about my&nbsp;dad’s will that&nbsp;I need to&nbsp;know immediately.<br>He&nbsp;went pale, and then he&nbsp;showed me&nbsp;the papers that stated that my&nbsp;dad wanted a&nbsp;man to&nbsp;live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;happy marriage with me&nbsp;for 15&nbsp;years and have 3&nbsp;kids together and if&nbsp;this man fulfilled this requirement, he’ll become the heir of&nbsp;my&nbsp;dad’s money. My&nbsp;dad didn’t mean Mark exactly, but my&nbsp;MIL immediately used this chance to&nbsp;make Mark a&nbsp;wealthy man. This explained everything to&nbsp;me, including Mark’s and his parents’ attitude to&nbsp;the kids.”</p><p>Rosa added, “You might ask me&nbsp;who was the woman named Anna? Turned out, Mark had been having a&nbsp;relationship with the woman he&nbsp;honestly loved for all these 15&nbsp;years that we&nbsp;were married, and he&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;finally propose to&nbsp;her after he&nbsp;would be ’free and wealthy.’”</p><p>The woman added, “I’ve hired the best lawyer in&nbsp;the state to&nbsp;help me&nbsp;leave Mark and his greedy family without a&nbsp;cent. They’re not going to&nbsp;receive my&nbsp;dad’s money, but the legal process is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;long and tough. My&nbsp;FIL keeps asking me&nbsp;to&nbsp;give his son a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;prove that he&nbsp;loves&nbsp;me. He&nbsp;said multiple times that my&nbsp;dad wanted me&nbsp;to&nbsp;live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;long and happy marriage and that his last wish was fulfilled, and&nbsp;I must be&nbsp;grateful for that.<br>But I’m not going to&nbsp;look back and the only thing&nbsp;I want now is&nbsp;justice for everyone, and&nbsp;I know that Mark and his mother will get what they deserve very, very soon.”</p><p>And here’s yet another story, where an&nbsp;unexpected revelation ruined a&nbsp;seemingly happy family. A&nbsp;woman, whose <a href=#>husband</a> turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;creep, was able to&nbsp;discover his nasty deeds after she found a&nbsp;tampon in&nbsp;his car.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZuu9WeqaGdkaexbq2MnKanrpWnwKLAyKilZpqVqcSmsc1mpLJlmKrAo63NnWSappRiuqq4jJqlnWWUnsCku9WeqZ6cXam1osCMprBmaWVixqat0Wakmqqinq6osYyiqmaZXZ3CqLGMpaCeZWhmhnmFkGg%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./my-moment-rebecca-blacks-friday-followup-has-all-the-auto-tune-you-expected.html>&#171;&nbsp;My Moment: Rebecca Blacks Friday Followup Has All the Auto-Tune You Expected</a>
