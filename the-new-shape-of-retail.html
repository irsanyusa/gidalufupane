The inventor of Spanx shapewear and founder of the company that sells it, Blakely recalls pitching her first product, a pair of slimming, footless pantyhose designed to be invisible even under a pair of pants. A cold call to Neiman Marcus in 2000 got her a meeting, but after five minutes the buyer started to lose interest. Blakely ditched the prepared pitch and moved the meeting into the bathroom. There she changed into a pair of ill-fitting cream pants and pointed to the resulting lumps, bulges and panty lines. She modeled them again–this time with Spanx underneath–and closed the deal, no explanation necessary. Neiman Marcus promptly began selling Spanx.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This is the emotional experience–a beauty secret shared between friends in a ladies’ room–that Blakely, 41, hopes to replicate with her company’s first stand-alone retail store. Spanx plans to open its first three outlets in October at destination malls in Tysons Corner, Va., Paramus, N.J., and King of Prussia, Pa. While many other retailers are scrambling to transform their brick-and-mortar businesses into online empires, Blakely is doing just the opposite. After first selling Spanx in high-end department stores like Neiman Marcus, the company expanded quickly. The brand is now sold at nearly 12,000 retailers worldwide, from Europe to Australia. Spanx moved online in 2000, when the footless tights appeared on Oprah Winfrey’s annual list of her favorite things. (Blakely quickly set up a website to handle the post-Oprah windfall.) Online sales of Spanx products have been “robust,” according to CEO Laurie Ann Goldman, but the bulk of the company’s sales still happen in stores. “Our business is all about emotion–this feeling of women coming together, being honest about the help they might need and knowing we’re all in this together,” Blakely says. “When you’re doing everything online, you miss a lot of that connection.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Camaraderie and female support are woven into the corporate culture at Spanx. The walls of its Atlanta headquarters are painted hot pink, and Dolly Parton’s “9 to 5” blasts in the background, making it feel more like a sorority house than a corporate office. (Blakely was a member of Delta Delta Delta at Florida State University.) Blakely says customers can expect this same “You go, girl” aesthetic at the Spanx brick-and-mortar stores. Some of the features are gimmicky, like an interactive “affirmation station” at which customers can hear positive catchphrases from Sunny, the cartoon doppelganger of Blakely that adorns Spanx’s packaging. Blakely is serious, though, about training salespeople and making sure they can give customers firsthand advice about the products. “This is definitely a girlfriend-to-girlfriend business, and these stores are going to be a place where you can go and the sales associates know your name and your bra size,” she says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Marshal Cohen, a retail analyst for the NPD Group, says this messaging strategy is Spanx’s biggest advantage over its competitors. It may have reinvented shapewear–turning the embarrassing experience of wearing a girdle into something that celebrities happily discuss on the red carpet–but rivals were quick to catch on. Spanx is still the category leader, but as the shapewear industry has grown–tripling over the past decade to more than $750 million–the company has lost some market share to competitors that already have a strong in-store presence, like Maidenform, American Eagle and Victoria’s Secret.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So Spanx is doing more of what it does best–and building stores to showcase it. “The core of Spanx has always been about shapewear, but with a bit of whimsy,” says Catherine Moellering, executive vice president of Tobe, a fashion and retail consulting firm. “If Blakely can continue to expand with products that are seen as secret helpers, the consumer will move with her.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s a strategy that other retailers have also adopted. The high-fashion online retailer Net-a-Porter set up pop-up “window shops” in Paris, London, New York City, Berlin and Sydney. E-commerce giants like Amazon, eBay and Google have been tinkering with their own storefront strategies, erecting pop-up shops that showcase products customers prefer to try out and feel before they buy, such as cosmetics and flat-screen TVs. The trendy eyeglass retailer Warby Parker, meanwhile, set up showrooms at retailers in several cities because there is no way to replace the experience of trying on frames in person and will open a brick-and-mortar flagship store as well. Footwear companies Ugg and Croc have also benefited from opening stand-alone stores that separate their products from those of competitors.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As a way for retailers to establish and promote a unique brand identity, flagship stores are nothing new: Nike opened Niketown in 1990, and Apple opened its first store in 2001. But for a company like Spanx, which has traditionally driven most of its sales through department stores, there is a new urgency. In-store retail sales in the U.S. grew only 5% last year, far behind e-commerce, at 13%. Boutique retailers, though, are far outperforming department stores. The NPD Group reported that in-store sales of intimate apparel grew 2.2% from June 2011 to June 2012 in specialty stores, compared with a 1.1% drop at department stores and a 5.3% drop at national chains. Rather than relying on department-store clerks to sell Spanx and other brands, the company is taking control of the shopping experience. “The big benefit is that Spanx can offer the full range of products as opposed to being subject to retailers cherry-picking,” says Cohen. “It’s also helpful to have dedicated staff translate what the product can do. What makes Spanx more expensive is what makes Spanx better. When you rely on someone else to convey that message, it’s a game of telephone. By the time it reaches the consumer, it’s been diluted.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Spanx executives say the company, with about $250 million in annual revenue, has been growing steadily and has weathered the storm buffeting its department-store partners. A dreary economy has helped. Lingerie has historically been a recession-proof industry, with shapewear tending to reflect the so-called lipstick effect, in which cash-strapped consumers in hard times are still willing to shell out for small perk-me-ups. IBISWorld reported that lingerie revenue contracted 3.7% and 4.9% in 2008 and 2009, respectively, compared with 7.1% and 7.8% drops in women’s clothing overall for those years. “Women get emotional about finally being able to wear things in their closet they’ve long given up on. And I think that’s especially true when economic times are tough,” Blakely says. Fashion trends are also working in Spanx’s favor. Popular TV shows like Mad Men and Boardwalk Empire, which glamorize the exaggerated silhouettes of earlier decades, have influenced apparelmakers. They are designing contemporary versions of the tight pencil skirts and formfitting dresses that made girdles a fashion necessity the first time around.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Fashion is fickle, though, and Spanx is trying to make the leap to a lifestyle brand, moving into a wide range of products aside from shapewear. The new stores will feature bras, activewear, swimwear and a collection of compression tees, tanks and underwear for men that the company has rolled out over the past 12 years. “The roots of the company have always been about solving problems, not a category of merchandise,” says CEO Goldman. Well-trained salespeople will be a crucial piece of that strategy, and the company plans to give them enough free product to make sure that they wear the garments themselves and can tell customers exactly what works and why. Blakely is now a billionaire–not quite the relatable best friend in the ladies’ room–so it will be up to her employees to take over that role, with a little show-and-tell when necessary.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9tbWpjbYFwwMeeZKedp2LAqa3PnmSonl2nsrWtyKVm</p></div><div id=links><a href=./argentina-diego-lerman-netflix-san-sebastian-film-festival-1236089594.html>&#171;&nbsp;Argentinas Diego Lerman Reaches for the Skies in The Man Who Loved UFOs, Vies for the</a>
