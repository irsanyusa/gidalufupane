nearly everything about what happens next is up to <a href=#>Judge Juan Merchan</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The experienced New York Supreme Court judge who has presided over Trump’s Manhattan trial has several thorny decisions before him including whether he should send a former President to jail or probation, and if any sentence should be postponed until after Trump has exhausted his appeals. Every decision will reverberate across the political landscape and, depending on the timing, could greatly affect the election in November.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That’s a lot of power vested in one person. Here’s a look at the decisions that Merchan faces involving Trump’s future now that he's convicted.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Revisiting Trump’s bail conditions</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The first decisions came almost immediately after jurors notified the judge they had found Trump guilty. After that, the jury’s duties were complete and Judge Merchan dismissed them. It is up to the individual jurors to decide if they want to talk to reporters or the legal teams after the case about why they voted the way they did.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Immediately after the guilty verdict came in, prosecutors had an opportunity to ask the judge to increase Trump’s bail, a common request that is meant to act as a guarantee that a newly convicted defendant will return to court for the sentencing hearing and any other court requirements related to the case. In some trials, prosecutors argue that a defendant who has been found guilty presents an increased risk of fleeing and would ask the judge for stricter bail terms, including being remanded to jail until the formal sentencing hearing. Trump had posted a $175 million bond in the Manhattan fraud case. Merchan asked the prosecutor about the status of Trump’s bail. The prosecutor said, "no bail." Trump was released on his own recognizance until sentencing.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Trump's sentencing hearing is scheduled for July 11</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Even scheduling Trump’s sentencing hearing was politically fraught, given this year's election calendar. Judge Merchan set Trump's sentencing hearing for July 11. That means Trump will have to be back in the Manhattan courtroom days before the Republican National Convention kicks off on July 15 in Milwaukee.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the weeks leading up to the sentencing hearing, if standard procedures are followed, Trump will meet with a probation officer who will interview Trump and prepare a written report with a recommended sentence. The probation report will then be sent to the defense attorneys, the prosecution and the judge. And Trump’s legal team will have a chance to suggest sentencing terms and supply letters of support for Trump.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But the actual sentence is up to Judge Merchan to decide, and he will have a range of options before him. He could decide not to punish Trump at all by awarding him time served—essentially deciding that going through the trial was punishment enough, and that there was no further need for penalties. He could give Trump a “conditional discharge” with a requirement like community service. Or he could put Trump on probation with terms that he had to abide by in order to avoid jail time. Or Merchan could decide to send Trump to prison.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“There is a huge delta politically between a jail sentence and a sentence of probation. That’s going to be the most agonizing choice the judge will face,” says Norman Eisen, a senior fellow in governance studies at The Brookings Institution and former counsel to the Democrat-led House Judiciary Committee during Trump’s first impeachment.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For each of the 34 felony charges Trump is facing, the New York State sentencing guidelines call for 16 months to 4 years in prison. It is unlikely that a judge in Merchan’s position would decide those sentences should be served one after the other. If the judge considered all 34 counts to be part of a single action, he could rule that the prison time be overlapping, which would mean a maximum sentence of 4 years in prison.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Should Merchan believe a prison sentence is warranted, he also has leeway to sentence Trump to a much shorter time behind bars. The New York penal code allows judges to consider prison terms of one year or less for first-time fraud offenders.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In New York, a prison term of less than a year is usually served in the city prison on Rikers Island or in the Manhattan Detention Complex, commonly known as “The Tombs.” Prisoners with sentences longer than a year are usually sent to one of the New York state prisons.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Trump could appeal both his conviction and the judge’s sentence</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Trump’s lawyers are certain to appeal his conviction, a process that would likely stretch past Election Day. His first stop would be the Appellate Division in Manhattan. He could ultimately seek a review from New York’s highest court, the Court of Appeals in Albany.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the meantime, Merchan can issue his sentence. But that decision would also not necessarily be absolute. Even if Merchan decided to sentence Trump to prison, the former President would likely be permitted to stay out of jail, pending his likely appeals. Immediately following a potential sentencing hearing, Trump’s legal team would be able to march over to the Manhattan Appellate Courthouse at 25th Street and Madison Ave. to appeal the sentencing. “Most white collar cases get bail pending appeal. That’s just a fact,” says Diana Florence, a former long-time prosecutor in the Manhattan district attorney’s office.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Merchan previously showed a reluctance to send Trump to jail</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Judge Merchan has already shown that he doesn’t take lightly the idea of sending to jail a former President who is a leading candidate for the job again.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Merchan found Trump in contempt of court 10 times for violating his gag order by publicly criticizing witnesses, and fined him $1,000 for each violation. In court in early May, Merchan said that the fines clearly weren’t enough of a deterrent, and he would consider putting Trump behind bars, if prosecutors recommended it. Merchan acknowledged that the politics of such a decision were impossible to ignore.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Mr. Trump, it’s important to understand that the last thing I want to do is to put you in jail. You are the former president of the United States and possibly the next president, as well,” Merchan told Trump. Merchan said he considered incarcerating Trump “truly a last resort” and that he worried about the people who would have to enforce his orders, including the court officers, the corrections officers and Trump’s Secret Service detail. “I worry about them and about what would go into executing such a sanction,” Merchan said.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But Merchan made clear he was willing to jail Trump if he felt it was needed to defend the judicial system and compel Trump’s respect for the process.&nbsp; “Your continued violations of this court’s lawful order threaten to interfere with the administration of justice in constant attacks which constitute a direct attack on the rule of law. I cannot allow that to continue,” Merchan said. “So, as much as I do not want to impose a jail sanction, and I have done everything I can to avoid doing so, I want you to understand that I will, if necessary and appropriate.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Now that the jury has convicted Trump, Merchan finds himself facing that same decision again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWhnhniFjq2prqWgYrCwutWimq2hn6N6q8HDoJxmopGeuXA%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./1570137-adam-demos-height-age-relationships-movies-tv-shows.html>&#171;&nbsp;Adam Demos height, age, relationships, movies and TV shows</a>
