my-0.5 mr-2.5 font-zilla-slab">N</span>etflix’s hit sports documentary series <a href=#>Untold</a> kicks off its fourth season with an in-depth look at the career of NFL star quarterback Steve “Air” McNair and his 2009 murder at just 36 years old.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As TIME wrote back then, McNair had an “outstanding” 13-year <a href=#>NFL career </a>but “sadly, what we'll most remember about Air McNair is the shocking way in which he died.” He was found dead in his <a href=#>Nashville</a> apartment on July 4, 2009, lying next to his mistress, Sahel “Jenni” Kazemi, a Dave & Buster’s waitress. Police ruled the deaths were a murder-suicide by Kazemi.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Rodney Lucas and Taylor Alexander Ward, directors of Untold: The Murder of Air McNair, wanted to make a film that was not only about the tragedy of his death, but also about his incredible career.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">McNair was born in Mount Olive, Miss., where he excelled at several sports—basketball, baseball, and track. He played football at the <a href=#>historically black college</a> Alcorn State University in Lorman, Miss. and setting Division I-AA (now Football Championship Subdivision) records for career passing yards and total offensive yards. He was named I-AA player of the year and finished third in voting for the Heisman Trophy. From 1995 to 2007, he played for the NFL's Houston Oilers, Tennessee Titans, and <a href=#>Baltimore Ravens</a>. He famously led the Titans to the <a href=#>Super Bowl</a> in 2000, where they lost to the <a href=#>St. Louis Rams</a>. He won a NFL Most Valuable Player Award in 2003.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“As brilliant as Steve was, when he was killed, he became just another black man who was shot dead,” says Lucas. “This doc humanizes Steve.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For their hour-long film, Lucas and Ward had access to over 100 crime scene photos and the complete case files given to them by Charles Robinson, the lead detective on the case. Robert Gaddy, one of McNair’s friends, appears in the film, openly weeping as he recalls what it was like to visit McNair and find him dead, blood splattered all over his white sneakers. McNair’s former coaches, NFL team players, and fans appear throughout to tout his achievements.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So why did Kazemi kill McNair?&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Because she is dead, there may never be one definitive answer, but the film paints a picture of someone in a really vulnerable place. Robinson says in the film, “I think everything went downhill after Jenny started realizing that there were other women that Steve was also seeing and that she wasn’t the only one.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While McNair was a philanthropist and father, he was also a complicated person. He was not faithful to his wife, and Kazemi was one of several mistresses he had over the years. “He had an itch he had to scratch,” as his friend Gaddy puts it in the film.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Kazemi was stressed about her finances too. A month before the shooting, Kazemi texted McNair that she was on the verge of a “breakdown,” asking him to transfer $2,000 to her bank account. As the documentary shows, Sonya New, one of Kazemi’s co-workers at Dave & Buster’s, told authorities the day before the shooting, Kazemi told her she wanted to kill herself.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Kazemi was only 20 when she died, and in those 20 years, she had suffered a lot of heartbreak. She grew up in <a href=#>Tehran,</a> <a href=#>Iran</a>, and when she was 9 years old, her mother was murdered in a robbery. She immigrated to the U.S. at 13, living with an older sister in Jacksonville, Fla. But she had trouble fitting in socially and ended up dropping out of high school and moving to <a href=#>Nashville</a>, where she got a job at the Dave & Busters that McNair frequented.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ward hopes the film will be the definitive account of McNair’s career. “Our goal is to just tell the complete story as honestly and objectively as possible,” he said. He hopes viewers will be able to see McNair for more than his grisly death, arguing, “this brief moment shouldn't define or overshadow all the other things that came before.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZwaGFngHaFjqyrnq6VYrqkusCiqWaen6TBo63LpWSmraKZsrN5zZ6rn6GcrXqlu8KupJ6mpJa%2Funs%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./1192520-qualities-a-good-woman-a-relationship-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Qualities of a good woman in a relationship</a>
