When questioned about the reason, he said, "I got that from <strong>Tyler The Creator</strong>, back in 2015 because I'm a huge Tyler fan. He's the person that gives me that dark elements in the music. Like Tyler is kind of guy that I'll say, I ripped a pregnant bitch and told my friend I had the threesome. Like, what the fuck you say? It breeds. this is strategy is part of my branding. If I tweet in small letters, people know everyone."</p><p>"And those tweets are not just tweets, they are declarations. You cannot make declarations with small, small letters. I cannot say my album is going to be number one in small letters. I cannot see Jesus Christ in Lord is Lord in small letters. I cannot say that I'm going to conquer In small letters is a proclamation, is a declaration," he added.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-19>Best Song:</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"So 'Dog Eat Dog,' that's a song. [It is the ] best song in the world."</p><p>"And if you check if you check out, I wish I could bring out some tweets where I tweets I tweeted out if as dog eat dog is out.
