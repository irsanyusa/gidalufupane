Numerous studies conducted on couples were focused on such questions as how people fit together and what qualities man and woman need to possess to make the marriage last longer.</p><p class=align-left>Like any human being, a woman needs to have some qualities of a good person to be in a relationship with a man. Unlike man, a woman usually needs to make serious decisions that can change her life. Such decisions include to be a mother or a businesswoman, a feminist or a family-oriented woman, give birth to children or no, etc.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b737661fe0be63e0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>70+ interesting questions to ask your boyfriend when bored</span></p></a><h2>The qualities of a good woman</h2><p class=align-left>To make a right decision, a good woman needs to value good morals and understand the importance of being in positive relationships with other people. If she does so, she would probably be a dream of any man. Let’s find out what are the most important qualities of a woman that could fit every man.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b737661fe0be63e0.jpg><h3>1. She is family oriented</h3><p class=align-left>The perfect woman is perhaps a utopia, but every woman has to cultivate the qualities that would make her marriage happy and healthy. Valuing her family is the most important thing when it comes to a long-term relationship with a man. If the woman has a good relationship with her parents being close to her family, it doesn’t make her a bad person.</p><p class=align-left>A good woman always helps her close relatives in achieving their goals and supports in their life choices, whether insignificant or vital. She is always around but does not suffocate.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/bb6877e8e7afa773.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best tips on how to get a girlfriend</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt59cbq7811qr.jpg><h3>2. She is kindhearted</h3><p class=align-left>Sounds good but what doesn’t this mean when a woman is kindhearted? It is quite difficult to explain but to get the point across, it might be said that kindhearted woman is thoughtful, generous, loving, and caring. Everything she does is because of love. If she is smiling at you, it is not just for no reason, she wants to make you happy. And all you can do is just smile back.</p><p class=align-left>It is interesting that being a kindhearted person makes a woman even more attractive in the eyes of other people. It puts her in the public spotlight and makes her easy to hear. Such traits of character cannot be ignored by a man who is looking for a good woman.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> 10 qualities of a good wife and mother</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/bb6877e8e7afa773.jpg><h3>3. She is smart</h3><p class=align-left>An intellectually challenging woman has many more advantages over a physically attractive woman.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/22c48384bc8f085e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Useful tips on how to make a woman love you</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Moreover, science says that woman should be smarter than man. The thing is men are prone to dementia, and intellectually challenging women can protect them from this ailment. Besides, if the relationship lacks depth and intrigue, smart woman is able to hold real discussions about relevant topics. Marrying an intelligent and trustful woman is the best investment for every man.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt34fbcmt5lgag.jpg><h3>4. She is ambitious</h3><p class=align-left>An ambitious woman has her own vision for her life and knows what she wants. She is working hard to make her goals and dreams come true. Ambitious women are strong and mature, they are often chosen by ambitious men. Strong women motivate their men and support them in pursuing their goals. It is commonly believed that men prefer to marry weak women but statistics shows that smart, educated and wealthy men marry less often the so-called “weak” women who don’t have any goals.</p><p class=align-left>It is important that the woman had a life of her own. The long-term studies had been shown that having one’s own space, privacy, plans, dreams, goals, interests, hobbies is important not only for a person but the relationship with the partner. It can make a man happier and less bored if his woman’s life is intense and full of adventures.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt3m7ajji3220g.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Which men usually attract women? You will be excited to know!</span></p></a><h3>5. She is consistent</h3><p class=align-left>Being consistent is a hugely important treat of character. It is not just a state of being. If your woman is changing her mind more often than using a lady’s room, you might need to reconsider your choice. The truth is men are afraid of unpredictable women, and it’s such a pity when someone that you married turns out to be someone else. It is important to admit who you are, know what you like and hate, and have your own answers at least on the fundamental questions about your life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt1rjr5660rct.jpg><h3>6. She is understanding</h3><p class=align-left>Empathy and compassion are also crucial values a good woman should possess. Women who are critical towards their men are at the risk of losing them. What is more, a successful relationship is built on accepting a partner’s flaws and supporting him in the endeavors. If the woman is able to look at the socks thrown all over the flat without a hint of criticizing her man, he is lucky to have a good woman. Life can bring much more serious challenges than the mentioned above and the couple needs to be ready to face them together.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt1eqe68geqcbo.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is it being a perfect wife and mother?

Studies show that people who unconditionally forgive others live longer lives. Forgiveness makes relationships healthy as it is essential to understand that nobody is perfect.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>What do Nigerian men like in a woman?</p><h3>7. She is sociable</h3><p class=align-left>When it comes to making acquaintances and introducing to friends, every man wants her woman to be sociable and friendly. It is totally understandable that if you are sharing your life, you need to share all the areas. Men might expect their women to behave in accordance with the requirements of the specific social occasion, follow the rules of the particular social group and be able to avoid or solve the conflicts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/22c48384bc8f085e.jpg><h3>8. She does not panic</h3><p class=align-left>One could list so many reasons to panic in even an everyday life, but they might also be the reasons to remain calm. A good woman knows how to keep her unwanted emotions under control and handle things well. She also knows how to calm his man down when arguing. It doesn’t mean that she should agree to everything. But the important thing is to deal with disagreements to build a stable relationship.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt6292rnqdpbe.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 top beautiful messages to make your wife smile in the morning</span></p></a><h2>9. She has a sense of humor</h2><p class=align-left>It is believed that men should have a great sense of humour, but it is important that a woman had a good sense of humor as well. Similarly to their personalities, the senses of humour need to match too. Imagine that man is in a good, light mood, but a woman is too always serious and dry. Sooner or later, it will cause tension if he makes jokes, and she is always annoyed with his light and windy mood.</p><p class=align-left>A good woman has a positive outlook, and she tries to see the glass as half full. If your woman is toxic, it can have a bad influence on your health. Studies show that negative mood can lead to increased heart rate, impede digestion and lower concentration.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt2vqlhm1n0p8g.jpg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>How to be a good girlfriend to your boyfriend?</p><h3>10.

We could claim that physical attractiveness is not important, but it is difficult to build a happy relationship with someone you are not attracted to at all. So, the good news is we all are different, and every man is attracted to different types of woman as we all have different personal tastes.</p><p class=align-left>One who wants to find a good woman to marry needs to understand that physical beauty cannot be a final word.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt3m7ajji3220g.jpg><p class=align-left>While some men don’t really care about the qualities of a good woman in a relationship, it is important that woman possesses some qualities to make the relationship healthy, happy, and last longer. A good woman should be family-oriented, kindhearted, smart, ambitious, sociable, consistent, have a good sense of humour, be physically attractive, etc.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Who is a virtuous woman according to the Bible?</p><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnKFkW5paWWhqq6ttdOinKxlkWK0sLvDZq6opZGjeqJ50Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZaGsnaE%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./publication-du-decret-cus-quel-controle-de-letat-sur-les-organismes-hlm.html>&#171;&nbsp;quel contrle de l'Etat sur les organismes HLM ?</a>
