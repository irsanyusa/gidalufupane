Eurotrack study examines attitudes towards the EU</h2><p data-block-key=84dmg>Earlier in the year, reports emerged of <a href=#>Franco-Germans proposals</a> for a new structure for European integration, which would see an ‘inner circle’ of countries committed to further integration, as well as a new tier of ‘associate EU membership’ that could include countries like Norway, Switzerland and the UK.</p><p data-block-key=fnp4i>French president Emmanuel Macron <a href=#>is reported to favour the proposals</a>, and had hoped that the UK’s Labour party – likely to form the next government – could be attracted with the associate membership option.</p><p data-block-key=csmc5>Now a new YouGov Eurotrack study finds support for the proposed structure across six EU member states in Western Europe – Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Sweden – as well as Great Britain.</p><p data-block-key=4o5au>However, in only one nation surveyed – Spain – do a majority support introducing this structure, at 56%. Around four in ten Germans (42%) and Italians (40%) also back the move, with 28-30% opposed.</p><p data-block-key=669fj>In France the proposal is backed by 35% to 30%, with Danes answering at a similar rate (36% vs 31%). Swedes, however, are divided 31% to 30%.</p><p data-block-key=t4ai>Over in Britain, 35% support the new structure, while 24% are opposed.</p><p data-block-key=2d95a>It should be noted that “don’t know” rates are relatively high, ranging from 24-42% - unsurprising for a hypothetical and highly technical geopolitical proposal.</p><p data-block-key=849gb>Asked subsequently which of the proposed tiers they would want to be a part of, there is a noticeable lead for the ‘inner circle’ option in Spain (39%) and Germany (31%) compared to the other options.</p><p data-block-key=ff57c>Denmark and Sweden tend to express a preference for the ‘outer circle’, at 28% and 23% respectively.</p><p data-block-key=fgk7s>In France, Italy, and Britain, however, opinion is far more evenly divided, with preferences for the inner circle, outer circle, associate membership, and sitting outside of any structure all receiving 14-19% support.</p><h3 data-block-key=s79n9 id=should-there-be-greater-political-integration-in-the-eu>Should there be greater political integration in the EU?</h3><p data-block-key=1j9hu>An alternative question asked Europeans about the EU evolving in terms of powers rather than structure – whether more power and decision making should shift towards the EU, or back towards national governments.</p><p data-block-key=f0e7k>In Denmark, Sweden, Germany and Spain, the most common response is that the status quo should be maintained (36-46%). In Spain, however, this preference (36%) is almost tied with a desire to see greater political integration (34%), while just 12% wanted to see more powers passed back to national governments.</p><p data-block-key=d7rlv>The most common preference in France is for less political integration (28%), closely tied with keeping things about where they are now (25%). In Italy there is also a close split, with 27% preferring greater EU integration, 25% the status quo, and 21% less integration.</p><p data-block-key=be0hk>Between 6-11% in each country want to see the EU disband entirely.</p><h3 data-block-key=5lp85 id=what-do-europeans-think-of-past-and-future-eu-enlargement>What do Europeans think of past and future EU enlargement?</h3><p data-block-key=3dlsq>There is a sense in Western Europe that the EU was not strict enough with its enlargement, and has brought in too many countries that are not developed enough and/or do not share the appropriate values. This was the most common answer in each country surveyed, at 33-57%.</p><p data-block-key=fanqt>However, when we asked respondents to say whether they thought it was right or wrong to admit each individual country that has joined the EU since 2000, there is almost universally a view that it was right to do so.</p><p data-block-key=eq5n>The biggest exception is French attitudes towards Romania, with 40% saying it was wrong to admit the country compared to 28% who think it was right. The French are also divided on Bulgaria, and are joined by the Swedes in being divided on Hungary.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/EU_expansion_retrospective-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-block-key=c5nd0>General expectation in the countries surveyed is that the number of EU members will increase over the next 30 years (44-63%).</p><p data-block-key=97h4f>When it comes to bringing further countries into the EU, there is strong support (more than six in ten) for adding those affluent nations who have not yet joined – Iceland, Norway and Switzerland.</p><p data-block-key=23ev3>There is also overall support in each country to readmit the UK – although enthusiasm for this prospect is notably lower in France, Italy and Spain.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/EU_expansion_future-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3 data-block-key=ojq5m id=do-europeans-have-a-positive-view-of-the-eu-and-eu-membership>Do Europeans have a positive view of the EU and EU membership?</h3><p data-block-key=bdnop>The EU is especially popular in Spain and Denmark, where 72-73% have a favourable opinion of the institution compared to only 22-23% with an unfavourable one. A significant majority of Germans (62%) and Swedes (60%) also have a positive view. Despite Brexit, the EU is now seen favourably in the UK by 51% to 36%.</p><p data-block-key=1hg1f>By contrast, the French and Italians are divided on the EU, the former by 46% to 45% and the latter by 48% to 45%.</p><p data-block-key=eskbt>This division in France and Italy coincides with a tendency to think that being a part of the EU has been detrimental. More than four in ten French people (43%) and a similar number of Italians (40%) say their countries have been worse off for their EU membership. One in five in each country (20%) think membership has made no difference, while 26% in France and 31% in Italy think their countries are better off for their being a part of the EU.</p><p data-block-key=ejptl>The most common view in Sweden and Germany is that they are better off because of the EU (although at 37% and 46% respectively, this is not the majority view), while most in Spain (58%) and Denmark (65%) see membership as having been beneficial.</p><h3 data-block-key=7qr33 id=what-impact-has-the-eu-had>What impact has the EU had?</h3><p data-block-key=27mi9>When asked to rate the EU’s impact on Europe across eight different areas, each country’s public gives a net positive score overall.</p><p data-block-key=16gdk>In Sweden, Germany and France, the positive impact people are most likely to recognise is that on ‘movement of citizens in Europe’, with 56% to 67% saying the EU has been good for this. Only 12-23% think the EU has had a negative impact on the movement of Europeans around the continent.</p><p data-block-key=62khq>For Danes and Spaniards, the EU’s impact on human rights in Europe stands out the most, with 66-67% saying the institution has had a positive impact and only 9-11% a negative one.</p><p data-block-key=82a7m>Italians are most likely to say that the EU has had a positive impact on ‘European culture and heritage’ at 48%, with 17% taking the opposing view.</p><p data-block-key=9hruu>For Britons, the EU’s main success story is peace on the continent: 57% say the EU has had a positive impact here, and only 9% disagree.</p><p data-block-key=3f1hc>At the other end of the scale, it is noticeable that Italians are torn on the EU’s economic impact, being split 35% positive to 32% negative (and 23% no impact). The French are likewise more sceptical here than other nations, with 40% saying the EU has had a positive impact but 30% a negative one.</p><p data-block-key=9583j><a href=#><b>See the full results here</b></a></p><p data-block-key=e0smj><i>Photo: Getty</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnZG1%2BcX%2BMsJysrJWnu26x1KumqZ2Ro8Buv9Spp6iqpGKzs63NnKZmn5WnuqK6jJ%2BmrqpdqbamvoyerKunoJp6tMDRrpqtraKa</p></div><div id=links><a href=./bradley-cooper-always-takes-a-special-date-with-him-to-the-red-carpet-and-shes-not-his-gf-818100.html>&#171;&nbsp;Bradley Cooper Always Takes a Special Date With Him to the Red Carpet, and Shes Not His GF</a>
